 <p class = "textA"> We are a start up vacation company with multiple connections to cruise lines,hotels, and even resorts enabling us to match you
 with the perfect vacations for your needs hassle free</p>
 <p class = "textA">I lay asleep in the car crammed between my brother and my sister; 
 I open my eyes just in time to see a sign with half of the lights burnt 
 out that read "State Bridge, Resort, Saloon, Restaurant, and Lodging." By the looks of the sign, I had a feeling that this place was going to be a dump. The word "resort" led me to believe it wasn't that bad. The thought I always kept in the back of my mind was what a Hawke family "vacation" was. We would always spend the least amount of money as we could, and we would leave as soon as possible. 
 This, to my dad, was the greatest vacation.</p>
 <p class = "textA" >My sister and I tried to stay awake as long as possible, but I found my self drifting off quite frequently and laying my head on my brother's shoulder. I knew that this was going to cause havoc later because he hated when I would do that. I decided that it would cause less controversy if I looked at a magazine. I turned on the light and after a few minutes of reading, the light blinked once and burned out. Sleeping seemed to be my only other option.

<p class = "textA">Finally, I saw the first sign that showed the word "vacancy".
 This place looked considerably nice. When my dad stepped out of the van to go check in to the hotel, 
 two police cars drove up with their sirens screaming and lights flashing. Dazed and confused, 
 I was trying to figure out what the commotion was. Then I noticed a man lying on the side of the highway next to the curb.</p> 
 <p class = "textA" >The two police officers got him to his feet and helped him stagger to the back seat of the police car.
 He obviously had too much to drink.
 With the blink of an eye, the police officers were gone and my dad was back in the van in less than 30 seconds.
 Needless to say, we were not going to stay there so we were off to the next town.</p>
